Fake news game confers psychological resistance against online misinformation,"Roozenbeek, J; van der Linden, S","The spread of online misinformation poses serious challenges to societies worldwide. In a novel attempt to address this issue, we designed a psychological intervention in the form of an online browser game. In the game, players take on the role of a fake news producer and learn to master six documented techniques commonly used in the production of misinformation: polarisation, invoking emotions, spreading conspiracy theories, trolling people online, deflecting blame, and impersonating fake accounts. The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of the game with N = 15,000 participants in a pre-post gameplay design. We provide initial evidence that people's ability to spot and resist misinformation improves after gameplay, irrespective of education, age, political ideology, and cognitive style.",2019,2019 Jun 25,PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS,5,,,,10.1057/s41599-019-0279-9,,#6,Roozenbeek 2019,,Demo - University; Intervention-based Individual; Intervention-lab; Theory-Inoculation; Topic - Game
A systematic literature review of the motivations to share fake news on social media platforms and how to fight them,"Melchior, C; Oliveira, M","This review aims (a) to investigate the motivations to share fake news on Social Media Platforms (SMPs) according to the Self-Determination Theory (SDT); (b) to identify the solutions to fight these motivations and the agents in charge of implementing them; and (c) the user's role in this process. We reviewed 64 journal articles published up to April 2022. Misinformation belief and entertainment stood out as the most cited intrinsic motivations, while self-promotion, conspiracy theory, and political ideology were the most cited extrinsic motivations in the reviewed literature. The main solutions to fight fake news spreading on SMPs are improving users' digital literacy, refining interventions, rating headlines, and sources, and promoting users' engagement to consume content sustainably. These interventions should be adopted by four agents: governments, SMPs, civil society, and private health organizations. However, the role of SMP users themselves is critical in this process.",2024,2024 Feb,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,26,2,1127-1150,,10.1177/14614448231174224,,#21,Melchior 2024,,Review (Intervention)
Gamifying fake news: Engaging youth in the participatory design of news literacy games,"Literate, I; Chang, YK; Hsu, SY","This article discusses the potential of participatory game design to encourage and capture youth reflection, discussion, and participation around news literacy topics. Based on data obtained during a game design workshop with youth participants, we analyze two youth-produced games about fake news and discuss the personal, social, and cultural dimensions of youth attitudes and practices in relation to news literacy, as manifested through the process of game design. Our findings paint a rich picture of the ways in which youth understand and engage with fake news, their attitudes toward news literacy, and their playful approaches to collaboratively designing and prototyping news literacy games. This research sheds light on the opportunities and challenges related to the use of games and participatory game design for news literacy research and education, while also contributing to our understanding of the emerging processes that can support youth's roles as designers, and not only consumers, of educational games about the news.",2020,2020 Jun,CONVERGENCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH INTO NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES,26,3,503-516,,10.1177/1354856520925732,,#39,Literate 2020,,Demo - Youth; Intervention-Field; Intervention-based Social; Topic - Game
"Literacy Concepts as an Intervention Strategy for Improving Fake News Knowledge, Detection Skills, and Curtailing the Tendency to Share Fake News in Nigeria","Apuke, OD; Omar, B; Tunca, EA","This study examined the role of literacy concepts (information, news, media, and digital literacies), as an intervention strategy, in improving fake news knowledge, detection skills, and curtailing the tendency to share fake news among social media users. In doing so, this study used the inoculation theory and message interpretation process (MIP) theory to provide a useful explanation for literacy concept intervention. An experiment was carried out to test the effects of literacy intervention on the treatment group which were later compared with the results deduced from the control group who did not receive any intervention. It was found that participants in the experimental group demonstrated a higher knowledge of fake news, better ability to detect fake news and shared more accurate news articles, as compared to their counterparts who were in the control group.

Playing an Augmented Reality Escape Game Promotes Learning About Fake News,"Buchner, J","The spread of fake news poses a global challenge to society, as this deliberately false information reduce trust in democracy, manipulate opinions, and negatively affect people's health. Educational research and practice must address this issue by developing and evaluating solutions to counter fake news. A promising approach in this regard is the use of game-based learning environments. In this study, we focus on Escape Fake, an augmented reality (AR) escape game developed for use in media literacy education. To date, there is limited research on the effectiveness of the game for learning about fake news. To overcome this gap, we conducted a field study using a pretest-posttest research design. A total of 28 students (14 girls, mean age = 14.71 years) participated. The results show that Escape Fake can address four learning objectives relevant in fake news detection with educationally desired effect sizes: Knowledge acquisition (d = 1.34), ability to discern information (d = 0.39), critical attitude toward trustworthiness of online information (d = 0.53), and confidence in recognizing fake news in the future (d = 0.41). Based on these results, the game can be recommended as an educational resource for media literacy education. Future research directions are also discussed.",2024,2024 Jun 19,TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING,,,,,10.1007/s10758-024-09749-y,,#51,Buchner 2024,,Demo - Youth; Intervention-based Individual; Intervention-lab; Topic - Game
"Combating fake news, disinformation, and misinformation: Experimental evidence for media literacy education","Adjin-Tettey, TD","This study investigated the effect of media and information literacy (MIL) on the ability to identify fake news, disinformation and misinformation, and sharing intentions. The experimental approach was selected to study both the control group and experimental group made up of a total of 187 respondents. Comparative analysis of the two groups revealed that although more respondents in the experimental group were able to identify the inauthenticity of information presented to them, some of the respondents in the control group were also able to do the same, even though they did not receive MIL training. Conversely, some respondents in the experimental group, even though they were trained in MIL, could not determine the inauthenticity of information, possibly because the one-off training given to them did not allow them to assimilate all the information in one sitting. Nonetheless, the results of the bivariate correlation computation showed that MIL trained respondents were more likely to determine authenticity or otherwise of information and less likely to share inaccurate stories. This means that when MIL increases, sharing of fake news decreases. This is yet another evidence that MIL enables information consumers to make informed judgments about quality information. It is recommended that MIL is incorporated into mainstream educational modules and consistently revised to reflect the demands of the times. MIL programs must also consider how to effectively reach those without formal education. Actors within the information, communications, and media ecology must contribute to their quota in making information consumers more discerning with the right MIL sensitisation.",2022,2022 Dec 31,COGENT ARTS & HUMANITIES,9,1,,,10.1080/23311983.2022.2037229,,#53,Adjin-Tettey 2022,,Intervention-based Individual; Intervention-lab; Non US

We randomly divided participants into three groups, including the control group (N = 235), audio-visual media-based group (N = 118) and non-audio-visual media-based group (N = 117). The experimental groups were exposed to 8 weeks of training to improve their social media literacy skills to fight fake news. The study showed that participants exposed to social media literacy skills through audio-visual-based intervention reported better social media knowledge, demonstrated a better ability to spot fake news, and the inclination to share accurate news from the list of fake news, compared to the non-audio-visual based intervention group and the control group. Overall, social media literacy skills were found to be impactful in fighting fake news. We recommend relevant authorities and organisations to intensify their efforts to improve the public's social media literacy to help halt the spread of misleading information. Audio-visual-based intervention should be employed to educate social media literacy, to boost the effectiveness of programmes to combat fake news.",2023,2023 Dec 21,INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT,,,,,10.1177/02666669231217236,,#56,Zhao 2023,,Demo - University; Intervention-lab
Do You Know What Fake News Is? An Exploration of and Intervention to Increase Youth's Fake News Literacy,"Tamboer, SL; Vlaanderen, A; Bevelander, KE; Kleemans, M","Youth should be correctly informed about what is happening in the world, but research on empowering people to identify fake news rarely targets youth. To take the first steps in increasing their fake news literacy, this study (N = 298) qualitatively looks into youth's (10-12 years old) fake news knowledge and quantitatively tests a fake news e-learning intervention (i.e., an online lesson in which youth learn about fake news and possible solutions). Our investigation of youth's fake news knowledge showed that, before participating in the intervention, youth already had some knowledge of what fake news is and were aware of its problem. The intervention aimed to increase youth's knowledge, awareness, and self-efficacy toward fake news. Although it did not increase youth's knowledge or awareness of fake news, it successfully stimulated their self-efficacy in identifying fake news.",2024,2024 May,YOUTH & SOCIETY,56,4,774-792,,10.1177/0044118X231205930,,#61,Tamboer 2024,,Demo - Youth; Intervention Formal (classroom); Intervention-based Individual; Non US
Fostering the truthful individual Communicating media literacy in the comic Bamse,"Abalo, E; Nilsson, J","This study examines the construction of media literacy in a special issue on source criticism of the Swedish children's comic Bamse - Varldens Starkaste Bjorn [Bamse - The World's Strongest Bear]. This is done with the purpose of understanding what values, perspectives, and practices are promoted when media literacy is communicated via children's edutainment media. Using narrative and discourse analysis, we problematise how notions of truth (such as post-truth) guide much of the discourse on digital media in today's post-political society, and how that and individualisation shape notions of media literacy. This is visible in the analysed case in how source criticism is constructed in relation to notions of truth and falsehood, and as moral lessons aimed at the individual media user. We argue that such an individualised, decontextualised, and depoliticised take on media literacy is problematic and an expression of neoliberalism and a middle-class gaze.",2021,2021 Jan,NORDICOM REVIEW,42,1,109-123,,10.2478/nor-2021-0032,,#68,Abalo 2021,,Demo - Youth; Intervention Formal (classroom); Non US; Topic - Conceptual
Fighting cheapfakes: using a digital media literacy intervention to motivate reverse search of out-of-context visual misinformation,"Qian, SJ; Shen, CH; Zhang, JW","As a significant source of misinformation, out-of-context visual misinformation refers to visuals presented in an unrelated context. This study explores whether a digital media literacy intervention that features reverse image search tools has significant effects on participants' message credibility judgment, discernment of visual misinformation, and intention of using reverse image search tools. Data were collected from a pre-registered, web-based, between-subjects experiment (N = 905). Results revealed a significant difference on intention of using reverse search tools among three experimental conditions: active intervention that involved both knowledge and behavior, passive intervention that involved knowledge only, and a control condition. Specifically, active intervention significantly increased intention of using reverse search tools, compared to the passive intervention and the control. Neither active nor passive intervention had an effect on credibility judgment or misinformation discernment. We discuss the implications for future digital media intervention designs and journalism practice that aim to combat visual misinformation.
 Lay Summary
 Social media platforms have become a fertile ground for producing and disseminating visual misinformation. One specific form of visual misinformation involves images that are presented in a false context. We designed a digital media literacy intervention that motivates and teaches users to reverse search news images when they encounter news posts on social media. We ran an online experiment comparing three groups, namely active intervention that involved providing information and instructing a reverse search practice, passive intervention that only involved providing information, and a control group where participants read irrelevant information. We found that active intervention increased individuals' motivation to use reverse image search in the future compared to passive intervention and the control group. The intervention did not have an impact on the evaluation of message credibility and misinformation discernment. Our findings suggest the potential of using a brief digital media literacy intervention to motivate future image verification practices among social media users. Social media platforms are recommended to empower users with digital literacy interventions to foster critical media consumption habits.",2023,2023 Jan,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,28,1,,,10.1093/jcmc/zmac024,,#69,Qian 2023,Chris Coward (2024-08-12 19:17:49)(Select): Reverse image search;,Intervention-based Individual; Intervention-lab
Can Media Literacy Intervention Improve Fake News Credibility Assessment? A Meta-Analysis,"Lu, C; Hu, B; Bao, MM; Wang, C; Bi, C; Ju, XD","Fake news impacts individuals' behavior and decision-making while also disrupting political processes, perceptions of medical advice, and societal trends. Improving individuals' ability to accurately assess fake news can reduce its harmful effects. However, previous research on media literacy interventions designed for improving fake news credibility assessments has yielded inconsistent results. We systematically collected 33 independent studies and performed a meta-analysis to examine the effects of media literacy interventions on assessing fake news credibility (n = 36,256). The results showed that media literacy interventions significantly improved fake news credibility assessments (Hedges' g = 0.53, 95% confidence interval [0.29-0.78], p < 0.001). Gaming interventions were the most effective intervention form. Conversely, the intervention channel, outcome measurement, and subject characteristics (age, gender, and country development level) did not influence the intervention effects.",2024,2024 Apr 1,CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,27,4,240-252,,10.1089/cyber.2023.0324,,#72,Lu 2024,,Review (Intervention)
A digital media literacy intervention for older adults improves resilience to fake news,"Moore, RC; Hancock, JT","Older adults are especially susceptible to fake news online, possibly because they are less digitally literate compared to younger individuals. Interventions for older adults have emerged to improve digital literacy, although there has been little evaluation of their effectiveness in improving older adults' resilience to fake news. We report the results of a digital literacy intervention for older adults administered during the 2020 U.S. election. The intervention was a 1-hour, self-directed series of interactive modules designed to teach concepts and skills for identifying misinformation online. Consistent with our pre-registered hypothesis, older adults (M-age = 67) in the treatment condition (N = 143) significantly improved their likelihood of accurately discerning fake from true news from 64% pre-intervention to 85% post-intervention. In contrast, older adults in the control condition (N = 238) did not significantly improve (from 55% to 57%). The treated older adults were also more likely to employ strategies for identifying misinformation online compared to pre-intervention and the control group.",2022,2022 Apr 9,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,12,1,,,10.1038/s41598-022-08437-0,,#75,Moore 2022,,Demo - Elderly; Intervention-based Individual
Building resilience to misinformation in communities of color: Results from two studies of tailored digital media literacy interventions,"Lee, AY; Moore, RC; Hancock, JT","Interventions to build resilience to misinformation should consider the needs of communities of color, who experience (mis)information in unique ways. We evaluated digital media literacy interventions to improve misinformation resilience among four communities of color in the United States (Black, Latino, Asian American/Pacific Islander, Native American), which were designed by the nonprofit PEN America and community partner organizations. We assessed intervention efficacy in two studies: (1) a quasi-experimental field study among diverse participants recruited via community outreach and (2) a randomized controlled trial among Latinos recruited via a survey company (total N = 370). Results indicated that participants in both studies improved their comprehension of digital media literacy skills after taking the intervention. However, only those recruited via community outreach improved their ability to accurately identify true and false online news in a behavioral detection task.

Literacy at play: an analysis of media literacy games used to foster media literacy competencies,"Glas, R; van Vught, J; Fluitsma, T; de la Hera, T; G√≥mez-Garc√≠a, S","Media literacy is considered one of the key competencies to acquire in the 21st century. With games being recognized as having a large potential to train and educate, a wide range of games focusing on media literacy related topics such as fake news games, digital privacy, personal media habits, and practical media skills have sprung up over the years. All claim to foster media literacy skills and competencies. This begs the question how these games generally frame and understand media literacy, what competencies and skills they actually focus on, and through which game design choices. This paper thus asks: how media literacy games are designed to foster media literacy? Taking the Dutch Media Literacy Competencies Model as a departure point, we answer this question using a thematic analysis of 100 media literacy games and formal analysis of a smaller heterogeneous sample consisting of 12 games. We present a series of key findings involving the prominent presence of certain topics and competencies in the dataset, as well as prevalent design choices, allowing for a discussion of the current landscape of literacy games and underlying competencies and future potential for development.",2023,2023 Jun 21,FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION,8,,,,10.3389/fcomm.2023.1155840,,#98,Glas 2023,,Review (Intervention); Topic - Game

Fighting misinformation in college: students learn to search and evaluate online information through flexible modules,"McGrew, S; Chinoy, I","Purpose - College students need more support learning to effectively search for and evaluate online information. Without such skills, students are vulnerable to mis- and disinformation that may appear in their search results, Web browsing and social media feeds. This study investigated four short instructional modules four short instructional modules that were developed to be delivered asynchronously to teach effective approaches to online search and evaluation.
 Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study analyzed pre- and post-tests that students in two journalism courses completed before and after the modules. A total of 29 students completed written versions of the pre- and post-tests and 8 students participated in interviews in which they thought aloud while completing the pre- and post-tests. Written and oral responses were analyzed to understand students' search and evaluation strategies and how, if at all, these shifted from pre- to post-test.
 Findings - From pre- to post-test, students showed evidence of using strategies that were introduced in the modules to search for and evaluate online content. On the post-test, more students engaged in lateral reading to evaluate unfamiliar websites. used search operators and tools and more critically evaluated elements of the search engine results page.
 Originality/value - This study provides initial, positive evidence for the efficacy of embedding short, asynchronous modules in college courses to improve student& approaches to online searches and evaluations.

This paper provides researchers and policymakers with an overview of which individual-level interventions are likely to influence the spread of, susceptibility to, or impact of misinformation. We review the evidence for the effectiveness of four categories of interventions: boosting (psychological inoculation, critical thinking, and media and information literacy); nudging (accuracy primes and social norms nudges); debunking (fact-checking); and automated content labeling. In each area, we assess the empirical evidence, key gaps in knowledge, and practical considerations.

The role of social media literacy in infodemic management: a systematic review,"Ziapour, A; Malekzadeh, R; Darabi, F; Yildirim, M; Montazeri, N; Kianipour, N; Nejhaddadgar, N","Background The term infodemic refers to the proliferation of both accurate and inaccurate information that creates a challenge in identifying trustworthy and credible sources. Among the strategies employed to mitigate the impact of the infodemic, social media literacy has emerged as a significant and effective approach. This systematic review examines the role of social media literacy in the management of the infodemic.Methods Six databases, including SID, Magiran, Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science were systematically searched using relevant keywords. We included the relevant publications between 2012 and 2023 in our analysis. To ensure a qualitative assessment of the studies, we used the STROBE and AMSTAR checklists as evaluation tools. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guideline was used for the design of this review study. Finally, we organized the studies into groups based on similarities and retrieved and analyzed evidence pertaining to the challenges and opportunities identified.Results Eleven papers were included in this study after reviewing the retrieved studies. Five of them examined the effect of social media literacy and health literacy on acceptance of health behaviors. Four studies investigated the role of media literacy in managing misinformation and fake news related to health. Two studies focused on infodemic management and promoting citizen engagement during health crises. Results showed that health-related infodemics are derived from the users' lack of media knowledge, distrust of government service systems, local influencers and peers, rapid circulation of information through mass media messages, weakness of solutions proposed by health care providers, failure to pay attention to the needs of the audience, vertical management, and inconsistency of published messages.Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the importance of increasing social media literacy among the general public as a recognized strategy for managing the infodemic.

Fighting fake news on social media: a comparative evaluation of digital literacy interventions,"Alon, AT; Rahimi, ID; Tahar, H","Effective digital literacy interventions can positively influence social media users' ability to identify fake news content. This research aimed to (a) introduce a new experiential training digital literacy intervention strategy, (b) evaluate the effect of different digital literacy interventions (i.e., priming critical thinking and an experiential training exercise) on the perceived accuracy of fake news and individuals' subsequent online behavioral intentions, and (c) explore the underlying mechanisms that link various digital literacy interventions with the perceived accuracy of fake news and online behavioral intentions. The authors conducted a study, leveraging online experimental data from 609 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to different digital literacy interventions. Next, participants were shown a Tweeter tweet containing fake news story about the housing crisis and asked to evaluate the tweet in terms of its accuracy and self-report their intentions to engage in online activities related to it. They also reported their perceptions of skepticism and content diagnosticity. Both interventions were more effective than a control condition in improving participants' ability to identify fake news messages. The findings suggest that the digital literacy interventions are associated with intentions to engage in online activities through a serial mediation model with three mediators, namely, skepticism, perceived accuracy and content diagnosticity.

In an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game group that played the developed online game, the quiz group that completed a quiz with no game element, and the control group that did not receive any treatment. Before treatment, the participants' perceived levels of intellectual civic skills were measured with a pre-questionnaire. After treatment, skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills as learning outcomes were measured with survey items on skepticism toward online information and an information discernment skills test, respectively. The results showed that the game effectively enhanced the cognitive aspect of media and information literacy (information discernment skills), but not the attitudinal aspect (skepticism toward online information). In addition, the game was found to be effective regardless of the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills, while quiz with no game element was found to be effective only when the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills was high. These findings demonstrate the importance of digital game-based intervention as an educational resource. We extend our discussion to the advantages and limitations of games in fostering learners' abilities to evaluate online information.",2021,2021 Feb,COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,161,,,,10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104057,,#171,Yang 2021,,Intervention-based Individual; Intervention-lab; Non US; Topic - Game
A tale about facts and opinions: The impact of a drama intervention on middle-school students' information literacy,"Taerning, B; Ternblad, EM; Gulz, A; Haake, M","Today, huge amounts of data are produced, collected, and presented in all kinds of contexts. The ability to critically examine and evaluate information and arguments in relation to empirical evidence is often referred to as information literacy. It is of utmost importance that students are adequately scaffolded to develop this ability, to be able to become democratic citizens. The study presented combines learning science and drama to explore whether this approach can make 6 grade students more aware of certain aspects of information literacy, such as false balance, the burden of proof, and filter bubbles. Half of the students watched a play and participated in a pedagogical follow-up before answering a questionnaire. The other half answered the questionnaire before the intervention. Results show that students watching the play had grasped the core of the more tangible questions, writing more elaborated and relevant answers than students in the control group.",2023,2023 SUM,INTERACTION DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURES,,57,65-81,,,,#179,Taerning 2023,,
"Combatting Visual Fake News with a Professional Fact-Checking Tool in Education in France, Romania, Spain and Sweden","Nygren, T; Guath, M; Axelsson, CAW; Frau-Meigs, D","Educational and technical resources are regarded as central in combating disinformation and safeguarding democracy in an era of 'fake news'. In this study, we investigated whether a professional fact-checking tool could be utilised in curricular activity to make pupils more skilled in determining the credibility of digital news and to inspire them to use digital tools to further their transliteracy and technocognition. In addition, we explored how pupils' performance and attitudes regarding digital news and tools varied across four countries (France, Romania, Spain, and Sweden). Our findings showed that a two-hour intervention had a statistically significant impact on teenagers' abilities to determine the credibility of fake images and videos. We also found that the intervention inspired pupils to use digital tools in information credibility assessments. Importantly, the intervention did not make pupils more sceptical of credible news. The impact of the intervention was greater in Romania and Spain than among pupils in Sweden and France. The greater impact in these two countries, we argue, is due to cultural context and the fact that pupils in Romania and Spain learned to focus less on 'gut feelings', increased their use of digital tools, and had a more positive attitude toward the use of the fact-checking tool than pupils in Sweden and France.",2021,2021 May,INFORMATION,12,5,,,10.3390/info12050201,,#180,Nygren 2021,,Demo - Youth; Intervention Formal (classroom); Intervention-Field; Non US
Educative Interventions to Combat Misinformation: Evidence from a Field Experiment in India,"Badrinathan, S","Misinformation makes democratic governance harder, especially in developing countries. Despite its real-world import, little is known about how to combat misinformation outside of the United States, particularly in places with low education, accelerating Internet access, and encrypted information sharing. This study uses a field experiment in India to test the efficacy of a pedagogical intervention on respondents' ability to identify misinformation during the 2019 elections (N = 1,224). Treated respondents received hour-long in-person media literacy training in which enumerators discussed inoculation strategies, corrections, and the importance of verifying misinformation, all in a coherent learning module. Receiving this hour-long media literacy intervention did not significantly increase respondents' ability to identify misinformation on average. However, treated respondents who support the ruling party became significantly less able to identify pro-attitudinal stories. These findings point to the resilience of misinformation in India and the presence of motivated reasoning in a traditionally nonideological party system.",2021,2021 Nov,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,115,4,1325-1341,,10.1017/S0003055421000459,,#192,Badrinathan 2021,,Domain-Politics; Intervention-lab; Non US
Empowering social media users: nudge toward self-engaged verification for improved truth and sharing discernment,"Tu, FJ","How can we empower social media users to better discern the veracity of news and share less false news? This survey experiment (N = 636) assessed the effectiveness of two interventions-signing a Pro-Truth Pledge and utilizing a Fact-Checking Guide. Results showed that utilizing the Fact-Checking Guide increased skepticism of news posts, likelihood to verify news posts, verification engagement, and reduced intention to share news without regard to news veracity. Before and after comparisons indicated that after verification engagement activities, truth and sharing discernment improved with higher factual accuracy ratings for true news, lower accuracy ratings for false news, and a greater likelihood to share true news compared to false news. Individual's engagement in verification was identified as a crucial mechanism through which the Fact-Checking Guide intervention led to better truth and sharing discernment.

The use of an escape room as an immersive learning environment for building resilience to misinformation,"Cho, Y; Coward, C; Lackner, J; Windleharth, TW; Lee, JH","The rise of misinformation as a prominent societal challenge has given rise to a plethora of educational efforts aimed at equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to successfully navigate this increasingly daunting information environment. Librarians are on the frontlines of this challenge and have called for new approaches that go beyond more conventional information literacy education. One approach gaining attention is games, and several have emerged with promising results, largely due to their immersive nature that allows players to experience the dynamics of misinformation. In particular, game environments can be designed to highlight the psychological and emotional dimensions of misinformation, arguably the most significant shortcoming of more skills-based approaches to discerning misinformation. In this study, we developed a misinformation escape room and conducted a pilot study in five public libraries to study its effectiveness. Initial findings are encouraging. The misinformation escape room program, consisting of the gameplay plus a debrief discussion, appeared to increase awareness of certain misinformation tactics (e.g. deepfakes), generate reflection on the psychological dimensions of misinformation, and shift attitudes in ways that made many players more cautious of misinformation, potentially influencing their future social media behaviors.",2023,2023 Nov 16,JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE,,,,,10.1177/09610006231208027,,#227,Cho 2023,,"Intervention - Informal (library, community center); Intervention-based Social; Topic - Game"

The game has been used as a distance learning tool in three different languages, French, Spanish and English, and has been applied to a large and open audience. Contributing to the literature body in the emerging field of online visual disinformation, this article aims to provide an analysis of the players' behavior and to assess to what extent the game has been able to attract their attention and achieve the objectives of therefore mentioned distance training tool. A quantitative methodology based on in-game post-play data will be used to study game engagement rate evolution. A detailed study of the inoculative strategies of the game determined which ones were more useful to avoid the drop-out of the tool. The findings of this analysis determine that this gamified intervention keeps high the level of users' engagement with the educational content and facilitate the inoculation of critical thinking to verify news and to avoid visual disinformation. Those findings will provide a better understanding of how young users reflect on media literacy and which is the best methodology to use on distance learning tools to motivate them to move from a simple opinion to constant and thorough verification.",2023,2023 Oct 2,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION,37,4,276-293,,10.1080/08923647.2023.2231814,,#252,Feltrero 2023,,Non US; Topic - Game

Prominent misinformation interventions reduce misperceptions but increase scepticism,"Hoes, E; Aitken, B; Zhang, JW; Gackowski, T; Wojcieszak, M","Current interventions to combat misinformation, including fact-checking, media literacy tips and media coverage of misinformation, may have unintended consequences for democracy. We propose that these interventions may increase scepticism towards all information, including accurate information. Across three online survey experiments in three diverse countries (the United States, Poland and Hong Kong; total n = 6,127), we tested the negative spillover effects of existing strategies and compared them with three alternative interventions against misinformation. We examined how exposure to fact-checking, media literacy tips and media coverage of misinformation affects individuals' perception of both factual and false information, as well as their trust in key democratic institutions. Our results show that while all interventions successfully reduce belief in false information, they also negatively impact the credibility of factual information. This highlights the need for further improved strategies that minimize the harms and maximize the benefits of interventions against misinformation.

Fighting the infodemic: the 4 i Framework for Advancing Communication and Trust,"Sundelson, AE; Jamison, AM; Huhn, N; Pasquino, SL; Sell, TK","Background The proliferation of false and misleading health claims poses a major threat to public health. This ongoing ""infodemic"" has prompted numerous organizations to develop tools and approaches to manage the spread of falsehoods and communicate more effectively in an environment of mistrust and misleading information. However, these tools and approaches have not been systematically characterized, limiting their utility. This analysis provides a characterization of the current ecosystem of infodemic management strategies, allowing public health practitioners, communicators, researchers, and policy makers to gain an understanding of the tools at their disposal.
 Methods A multi-pronged search strategy was used to identify tools and approaches for combatting health-related misinformation and disinformation. The search strategy included a scoping review of academic literature; a review of gray literature from organizations involved in public health communications and misinformation/disinformation management; and a review of policies and infodemic management approaches from all U.S. state health departments and select local health departments. A team of annotators labelled the main feature(s) of each tool or approach using an iteratively developed list of tags.
 Results We identified over 350 infodemic management tools and approaches. We introduce the 4 i Framework for Advancing Communication and Trust (4 i FACT), a modified social-ecological model, to characterize different levels of infodemic intervention: informational, individual, interpersonal, and institutional. Information-level strategies included those designed to amplify factual information, fill information voids, debunk false information, track circulating information, and verify, detect, or rate the credibility of information. Individual-level strategies included those designed to enhance information literacy and prebunking/inoculation tools. Strategies at the interpersonal/community level included resources for public health communicators and community engagement approaches. Institutional and structural approaches included resources for journalists and fact checkers, tools for managing academic/scientific literature, resources for infodemic researchers/research, resources for infodemic managers, social media regulation, and policy/legislation.
 Conclusions The 4 i FACT provides a useful way to characterize the current ecosystem of infodemic management strategies. Recognizing the complex and multifaceted nature of the ongoing infodemic, efforts should be taken to utilize and integrate strategies across all four levels of the modified social-ecological model.",2023,2023 Aug 30,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,23,1,,,10.1186/s12889-023-16612-9,,#322,Sundelson 2023,,Domain-Health; Review (Intervention); Topic - Conceptual

This study attempted to develop an online fake news game based on the inoculation theory, applicable to the pandemic context, and aimed at enhancing misinformation discrimination. It also tested whether perceived threat and persuasion knowledge serve as underlying mechanisms of the effects of the intervention on misinformation discrimination. In Study 1, we used online priming to examine the influence of inoculation on misinformation discrimination. In Study 2, we developed an online fake-news-game-based intervention and attempted to validate its effectiveness through a randomized controlled trial while also exploring the mediating roles of perceived threat and persuasion knowledge. In Study 1, brief inoculation information priming significantly enhanced the ability to recognize misinformation (F(2.502) = 8.321, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.032). In Study 2, the five-day game-based intervention significantly enhanced the ability to recognize misinformation (F(2.322) = 3.301, p = 0.038, eta(2)(p) = 0.020). The mediation effect of persuasion knowledge was significant (beta = 0.025, SE = 0.016, 95% CI = [0.034, 0.075]), while that of perceived threat was not significant. Online interventions based on the inoculation theory are effective in enhancing misinformation discrimination, and one of the underlying mechanisms of this effect lies in its promotion of persuasion knowledge.",2023,2023 Jan,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,20,2,,,10.3390/ijerph20020980,,#385,Ma 2023,,Intervention-lab; Theory-Inoculation; Topic - Game
Tackling misinformation with games: a systematic literature review,"Kiili, K; Siuko, J; Ninaus, M","Misinformation and fake news are severe threats to society. The role of critical reading skills is crucial in the battle against misinformation. Despite the promising results of game-based interventions to mitigate the effects of misinformation, the corpus of research on games supporting critical reading skills needs an overview. Therefore, a systematic literature review was conducted to analyze how games have been used to tackle misinformation and reveal game design trends. A total of 15 papers eventually met the defined inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The review revealed that the use of games in critical reading education had emerged recently and focused mainly on fake news. Most games were grounded on inoculation theory and consequently designed to expose players to weakened doses of the misinformation manipulation techniques to build resistance against them. So far, the games have been studied mainly in informal settings and with adult participants. The median sample size was 196, and the median playing time was 15 min across the studies reported in the papers. Although all the reviewed papers reported positive outcomes, the game-based learning research on the critical reading domain is not yet mature enough to generalize findings.",2024,2024 Jan 4,INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS,,,,,10.1080/10494820.2023.2299999,,#386,Kiili 2024,,Critique; Review (Intervention); Topic - Game
Psychological Underpinnings of Misinformation Countermeasures,"Ziemer, CT; Rothmund, T","There has been substantial scholarly effort to (a) investigate the psychological underpinnings of why individuals believe in misinformation, and (b) develop interventions that hamper their acceptance and spread. However, there is a lack of systematic integration of these two research lines. We conducted a systematic scoping review of empirically tested psychological interventions (N = 176) to counteract misinformation. We developed an intervention map and analyzed boosting, inoculation, identity management, nudging, and fact-checking interventions as well as various subdimensions. We further examined how these interventions are theoretically derived from the two most prominent psychological accounts for misinformation susceptibility: classical and motivated reasoning. We find that the majority of misinformation studies examined fact-checking interventions, are poorly linked to basic psychological theory and not geared towards reducing motivated reasoning. Based on this, we outline future research avenues for effective psychological countermeasures against misinformation.",2024,2024 Jan 23,JOURNAL OF MEDIA PSYCHOLOGY-THEORIES METHODS AND APPLICATIONS,,,,,10.1027/1864-1105/a000407,,#388,Ziemer 2024,,Review (Intervention); Topic - Psychology
Gamified Inoculation Interventions Do Not Improve Discrimination Between True and Fake News: Reanalyzing Existing Research With Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis,"Modirrousta-Galian, A; Higham, PA","Gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve the detection of online misinformation are becoming increasingly prevalent. Two of the most notable interventions of this kind are Bad News and Go Viral!. To assess their efficacy, prior research has typically used pre-post designs in which participants rated the reliability or manipulativeness of true and fake news items before and after playing these games, while most of the time also including a control group who played an irrelevant game (Tetris) or did nothing at all. Mean ratings were then compared between pre-tests and post-tests and/or between the control and experimental conditions. Critically, these prior studies have not separated response bias effects (overall tendency to respond ""true"" or ""fake"") from discrimination (ability to distinguish between true and fake news, commonly dubbed discernment). We reanalyzed the results from five prior studies using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, a method common to signal detection theory that allows for discrimination to be measured free from response bias. Across the studies, when comparable true and fake news items were used, Bad News and Go Viral! did not improve discrimination, but rather elicited more ""false"" responses to all news items (more conservative responding). These novel findings suggest that the current gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve fake news detection are not as effective as previously thought and may even be counterproductive. They also demonstrate the usefulness of ROC analysis, a largely unexploited method in this setting, for assessing the effectiveness of any intervention designed to improve fake news detection.",2023,2023 Sep,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL,152,9,2411-2437,,10.1037/xge0001395,,#390,Modirrousta-Galian 2023,Ryan Murtfeldt (2024-09-05 04:55:34)(Select): Requested;,Intervention-lab; Theory-Inoculation; Topic - Game; Topic - Psychology
Towards psychological herd immunity: Cross-cultural evidence for two prebunking interventions against COVID-19 misinformation,"Basol, M; Roozenbeek, J; Berriche, M; Uenal, F; McClanahan, WP; van der Linden, S","Misinformation about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a pressing societal challenge. Across two studies, one preregistered (n(1)=1771 and n(2)=1777), we assess the efficacy of two 'prebunking' interventions aimed at improving people's ability to spot manipulation techniques commonly used in COVID-19 misinformation across three different languages (English, French and German). We find that Go Viral!, a novel five-minute browser game, (a) increases the perceived manipulativeness of misinformation about COVID-19, (b) improves people's attitudinal certainty (confidence) in their ability to spot misinformation and (c) reduces self-reported willingness to share misinformation with others. The first two effects remain significant for at least one week after gameplay. We also find that reading real-world infographics from UNESCO improves people's ability and confidence in spotting COVID-19 misinformation (albeit with descriptively smaller effect sizes than the game).

Limits to inoculating against the risk of fake news: a replication study in Singapore during COVID-19,"Wong, CML; Wu, YY","The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the problem of fake news as one of the defining challenges of our time. The sudden proliferation of fake news and its direct impact on public health and safety led to increasing attention to pre-bunking interventions as a possible tool against the risks of fake news. These studies claimed that it is possible to use pre-emptive interventions such as games to induce cognitive resistance against the deception techniques deployed by fake new producers. We wanted to test if this method could be as effective in a non-Western context, and in an on-going catastrophic risk event. This paper presents the results of a replication study of Roozenbeek and van der Linden's gaming experiment with certain modifications tailored to the case of Singapore in 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We could not replicate the results of the original study. However, we found factors that could have accounted for the different results, including high levels of trust in English mainstream media and the government, and positive attitudes towards censorship. We also found that participants were most resistant against conspiratorial deception techniques but also more vulnerable to impersonation techniques. We reflect on what the results of our study say about the limitations of psychology-focused interventions and the need for a wider suite of interventions targeting different levels of analysis, including sociological factors and the risk context.",2023,2023 Oct 3,JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH,26,10,1037-1052,,10.1080/13669877.2023.2249909,,#394,Wong 2023,,Intervention-lab; Non US; Theory-Inoculation; Topic - Game; design implications
Technique-based inoculation against real-world misinformation,"Roozenbeek, J; Traberg, CS; van der Linden, S","In recent years, numerous psychological interventions have been developed to reduce susceptibility to misinformation. Inoculation theory has become an increasingly common framework for reducing susceptibility to both individual examples of misinformation (issue-based inoculation) and to the techniques and strategies that are commonly used to mislead or misinform people (technique-based inoculation). In this study, we address two open questions related to technique-based inoculation in two separate experiments (total n = 2188; convenience sample recruited via the Bad News online game platform): (i) can technique-based inoculation effectively reduce susceptibility to real-world misinformation that went viral on social media? and (ii) can technique-based inoculation confer cross-protection against misinformation that does not make use of any of the techniques against which people were inoculated? We find that playing a 15 min game confers psychological resistance against real-world misinformation that makes use of manipulation techniques against which people were inoculated (Cohen's d = 0.37, Cohen's U-3 = 64.4%, p < 0.001), and that cross-protection is achieved but at a reduced effect size (d = 0.10, U-3 = 54.0%, p = 0.001).",2022,2022 May 18,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,9,5,,,10.1098/rsos.211719,,#398,Roozenbeek 2022,,Theory-Inoculation; Topic - Game

"JEDi - a digital educational game to support student training in identifying portuguese-written fake news: Case studies in high school, undergraduate and graduate scenarios","Moreira, TD; Passos, CA; da Silva, FRM; Freire, PMS; de Souza, IF; da Silva, CRBS; Goldschmidt, RR","The problem of propagating disinformation (a.k.a. fake news) on social media has increased significantly in the last few years. There are several initiatives around the world to combat this serious problem. Maybe the most promising ones involve training people to identify fake news. The use of digital educational games (DEG) to implement such initiatives has presented significant results. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, most of the existing DEG applied to this purpose are designed for English-written News articles, leaving an important gap for news written in other languages, such as Portuguese, for example. Faced with this scenario, this article presents JEDi, a DEG that trains students to identify fake news written in Portuguese. JEDi is a version of the known Trail Game where the players must traverse the board by correctly distinguishing real from false news. We raise the hypothesis that as the students play JEDi, they develop the ability to recognize disinformation. It is also important to highlight that JEDi collects detailed data from every match in order to provide longitudinal analyses of each player's performance. This paper reports the application of JEDi in three case studies. While the first study involved 43 students from high school, the second and the third were developed with 29 undergraduate and 33 graduate students, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative results obtained in the three studies point to JEDi's effectiveness as a fake news detection training instrument. Mining techniques such as association rule mining were employed in data analysis and revealed frequent information that occurred simultaneously in JEDi's database (e.g. some mined association rules showed that even students who considered themselves experts in identifying fake news could improve their skills by playing successive rounds of the game).",2023,2023 Dec 4,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,,,,,10.1007/s10639-023-12309-z,,#404,Moreira 2023,,Demo - University; Demo - Youth; Intervention Formal (classroom); Intervention-based Social; Non US; Topic - Game
The Spot the Troll Quiz game increases accuracy in discerning between real and inauthentic social media accounts,"Lees, J; Banas, JA; Linvill, D; Meirick, PC; Warren, P","The proliferation of political mis/disinformation on social media has led many scholars to embrace ""inoculation"" techniques, where individuals are trained to identify the signs of low-veracity information prior to exposure. Coordinated information operations frequently spread mis/disinformation through inauthentic or ""troll"" accounts that appear to be trustworthy members to the targeted polity, as in Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 US presidential election. We experimentally tested the efficacy of inoculation against inauthentic online actors, using the Spot the Troll Quiz, a free, online educational tool that teaches how to spot markers of inauthenticity. Inoculation works in this setting. Across an online US nationally representative sample (N = 2,847), which also oversampled older adults, we find that taking the Spot the Troll Quiz (vs. playing a simple game) significantly increases participants' accuracy in identifying trolls among a set of Twitter accounts that are novel to participants. This inoculation also reduces participants' self-efficacy in identifying inauthentic accounts and reduced the perceived reliability of fake news headlines, although it had no effect on affective polarization. And while accuracy in the novel troll-spotting task is negatively associated with age and Republican party identification, the Quiz is equally effective on older adults and Republicans as it was on younger adults and Democrats. In the field, a convenience set of Twitter users who posted their Spot the Troll Quiz results in the fall of 2020 (N = 505) reduced their rate of retweeting in the period after the Quiz, with no impact on original tweeting.",2023,2023 Apr 3,PNAS NEXUS,2,4,,,10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad094,,#405,Lees 2023,"Chris Coward (2024-08-12 18:37:02)(Select): Like Euphorigen, one goal to make people less confident in their abilities;",Domain-Politics; Intervention-Field; Intervention-based Individual; Intervention-lab; Theory-Inoculation; Topic - Game
Testing the Efficacy of Attitudinal Inoculation Videos to Enhance COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: Quasi-Experimental Intervention Trial,"Piltch-Loeb, R; Su, MX; Hughes, B; Testa, M; Goldberg, B; Braddock, K; Miller-Idriss, C; Maturo, V; Savoia, E","Background: Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, a variety of COVID-19-related misinformation has spread and been amplified online. The spread of misinformation can influence COVID-19 beliefs and protective actions, including vaccine hesitancy. Belief in vaccine misinformation is associated with lower vaccination rates and higher vaccine resistance. Attitudinal inoculation is a preventative approach to combating misinformation and disinformation, which leverages the power of narrative, rhetoric, values, and emotion. Objective: This study seeks to test inoculation messages in the form of short video messages to promote resistance against persuasion by COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. Methods: We designed a series of 30-second inoculation videos and conducted a quasi-experimental study to test the use of attitudinal inoculation in a population of individuals who were unvaccinated (N=1991). The 3 intervention videos were distinguished by their script design, with intervention video 1 focusing on narrative/rhetorical (""Narrative"") presentation of information, intervention video 2 focusing on delivering a fact-based information (""Fact""), and intervention video 3 using a hybrid design (""Hybrid""). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to compare the main effect of the intervention on the 3 outcome variables: ability to recognize misinformation tactics (""Recognize""), willingness to share misinformation (""Share""), and willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine (""Willingness""). Results: There were significant effects across all 3 outcome variables comparing inoculation intervention groups to controls. For the Recognize outcome, the ability to recognize rhetorical strategies, there was a significant intervention group effect (P<.001). For the Share outcome, support for sharing the mis-and disinformation, the intervention group main effect was statistically significant (P=.02). For the Willingness outcome, there was a significant intervention group effect; intervention groups were more willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine compared to controls (P=.01). Conclusions: Across all intervention groups, inoculated individuals showed greater resistance to misinformation than their noninoculated counterparts. Relative to those who were not inoculated, inoculated participants showed significantly greater ability to recognize and identify rhetorical strategies used in misinformation, were less likely to share false information, and had greater willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Attitudinal inoculation delivered through short video messages should be tested in public health messaging campaigns to counter mis-and disinformation.",2022,2022 Jun,JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE,8,6,,,10.2196/34615,,#406,Piltch-Loeb 2022,,Domain-Health; Intervention-based Individual; Intervention-lab; Theory-Inoculation
Is the COVID-19 bad news game good news?

Previous research (Roozenbeek & van der Linden, 2019a, 2019b) has indicated that playing the ""Bad News"" game, in which a player spreads fake news to gain followers, reduces people's belief in fake news. The goal of the present paper was to test an analogous new game called ""COVID-19 Bad News (CBN)"" to improve one's eagerness to vaccinate against coronavirus. CBN was constructed to examine whether creating and disseminating fake news focused on vaccinations and the COVID-19 pandemic has a similar effect and improves people's attitudes toward vaccination. Two experiments were conducted where participants played CBN or Tetris and afterwards evaluated the credibility of statements about vaccines against COVID-19 and finally filled out a questionnaire concerning their attitudes toward vaccination. The results show that playing CBN does not reduce evaluations of the credibility of all statements that are un-favorable to vaccines (false as well as true). Additionally, it does not enhance readiness to vaccinate.

This is especially because climate change still represents a (socially) controversial topic and students may be confronted with misrepresentations and misinformation about climate change in their daily lives. Therefore, it is important that science teachers are equipped with skills to properly respond to or ""debunk"" climate change misinformation, and to train their students on how to identify and respond to misinformation. To address this, we developed an intervention based on inoculation theory and known debunking techniques to foster physics pre-service teachers' debunking skills as well as their self-efficacy to confront climate misinformation. Through the intervention, we showed that the participants increased their debunking skills and they showed more accurate assessments of their own skills. We conclude that this approach is promising to foster pre-service teachers' perceived competence to teach the demanding topic of climate change.

In this game, players take on the role of the misinformation spreader, intending to add more followers to their virtual accounts using different strategies. A total of 180 Chinese participants were randomly assigned to game-based inoculation, graphic-based inoculation, and control groups. The results indicated that both types of inoculation interventions significantly decreased the perceived credibility and sharing intention of misinformation. Game-based inoculation was more effective than graphic-based inoculation in terms of misinformation perceived credibility, and the intervention effects were stable after 2 weeks. The graphic-based inoculation contained the sleeper effect, which interventions required a period of time to take effect.

"How to ""inoculate"" against multimodal misinformation: A conceptual replication of Roozenbeek and van der Linden (2020)","Neylan, J; Biddlestone, M; Roozenbeek, J; van der Linden, S","Building misinformation resilience at scale continues to pose a challenge. Gamified ""inoculation"" interventions have shown promise in improving people's ability to recognize manipulation techniques commonly used in misinformation, but so far few interventions exist that tackle multimodal misinformation (e.g., videos, images). We developed a game called Cat Park, in which players learn about five manipulation techniques (trolling, emotional manipulation, amplification, polarization, and conspiracism), and how misinformation can spread through images. To test the game's efficacy, we conducted a conceptual replication (N = 380) of Roozenbeek and van der Linden's 2020 study about Harmony Square, with the same study design, item set, and hypotheses. Like the original study, we find that people who play Cat Park find misinformation significantly less reliable post-gameplay (d = 0.95, p < 0.001) compared to a control group, and are significantly less willing to share misinformation with people in their network (d = 0.54, p < 0.001). These effects are robust across different covariates. However, unlike the original study, Cat Park players do not become significantly more confident in their ability to identify misinformation (p = 0.204, d = - 0.13).

Misinformation interventions decay rapidly without an immediate posttest,"Capewell, G; Maertens, R; Remshard, M; van der Linden, S; Compton, J; Lewandowsky, S; Roozenbeek, J","In recent years, many kinds of interventions have been developed that seek to reduce susceptibility to misinformation. In two preregistered longitudinal studies (N1 = 503, N2 = 673), we leverage two previously validated ""inoculation"" interventions (a video and a game) to address two important questions in misinformation interventions research: (1) whether displaying additional stimuli (such as videos unrelated to misinformation) alongside an intervention interferes with its effectiveness, and (2) whether administering an immediate posttest (in the form of a social media post evaluation task after the intervention) plays a role in the longevity of the intervention. We find no evidence that other stimuli interfere with intervention efficacy, but strong evidence that immediate posttests strengthen the learnings from the intervention. In study 1, we find that 48 h after watching a video, participants who received an immediate posttest continued to be significantly better at discerning untrustworthy social media posts from neutral ones than the control group (d = 0.416, p = .007), whereas participants who only received a posttest 48 h later showed no differences with a control (d = 0.010, p = .854). In study 2, we observe highly similar results for a gamified intervention, and provide evidence for a causal mechanism: immediate posttests help strengthen people's memory of the lessons learned in the intervention. We argue that the active rehearsal and application of relevant information are therefore requirements for the longevity of learning-based misinformation interventions, which has substantial implications for their scalability.",2024,2024 Jun 21,JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,10.1111/jasp.13049,,#444,Capewell 2024,,Theory-Inoculation; Topic - Game

A marked increase in misinformation mitigation research was observed in 2020-2022. COVID-19, vaccines, and climate change were the most frequently addressed topics. Most studies used general population samples recruited online; few focused on populations most vulnerable to misinformation. Most studies assessed cognitive outcomes (e.g., knowledge), with fewer assessing health behavior, communication behavior, or skills. Correction (k = 97) was the most used misinformation mitigation strategy, followed by education and other literacy initiatives (k = 39) and prebunking/inoculation (k = 24). Intervention efficacy varied, with 76 studies reporting positive, 17 reporting null, and 68 reporting mixed results.

Drawing upon the BJ Fogg's Functional Triad for Persuasive Computers and paying particular attention to the usability and perceived credibility of Fake It to Make It, this research analyzed the game from a persuasive design lens using player‚Äêparticipant data. This was accomplished through screen‚Äêcaptured gameplay as well as interviews and retrospective think‚Äêalouds. Additionally, to determine if the game affects abilities to assess claims on social media, pre‚Äê and post‚Äêintervention media literacy assessments were utilized. With this data, the researchers provide design recommendations to increase usability, influence procedural knowledge on social media, and promote continued gameplay and greater emotional/behavioral impact.

Gamification as a Methodology to Enhance Analytical and Sustainable Engagement on Social Media,Paula Gil Ruiz,"This research examines the impact of gamification on the development of critical thinking skills to counter misinformation, focusing specifically on students' roles as developers of educational software. Involving 107 university students, this study employs an experimental pretest-posttest methodology. An educational Escape Room was implemented, and its influence on critical and digital competencies was scrutinized. The procedure comprised three stages: pretest measurement, formative intervention, and posttest evaluation. A comparative analysis of the scores for the questions highlights a pressing need to enhance media and digital literacy. The findings reveal a predominance of responses indicating improvements in source verification and fact-checking. However, no significant differences were observed in the pre and post responses (0.607 > 0.05), leading to the conclusion that the implementation of a technological training program does not significantly contribute to acquiring skills for identifying falsehoods and deceptions on the internet. In conclusion, the study underscores the necessity to develop effective strategies to address misinformation and recognizes gamification as a motivating educational tool.",2024,1/1/24,,,,,,,,#579,PaulaGilRuiz 2024,,Demo - University; Intervention Formal (classroom); Intervention-based Social; Topic - Game
Can High School Students Check the Veracity of Information about COVID-19? A Case Study on Critical Media Literacy in Brazilian ESL Classes,"Meyrer, Karin Paola; Kersch, Dorotea Frank","In a globalized world, critical media literacy is imperative when selecting the content we consume amid countless offers. Therefore, the purpose of this case study is to analyze which resources 3rd year high school students (16-17 years old) from an English as a Second Language class in Brazil use in the construction of authorial journalistic articles demystifying fake news about COVID-19 and if the interventions conducted previous to the task were helpful in their process of developing critical media literacy. To this end, firstly students analyzed news about COVID-19 from international websites; secondly, they discussed aspects of a video that circulated widely in WhatsApp chat groups; and, finally, they produced journalistic articles demystifying popular fake news about COVID-19 in Brazil. The findings suggest a great capacity of students to justify their perceptions about what is fact and what is fake once they were provoked to do so, showing the development of critical media literacy and news literacy through the arguments presented in their articles.",2022,1/1/22,Journal of Media Literacy Education,14,1,14-28,,,,#588,Meyrer 2022,,Demo - Youth; Intervention Formal (classroom); Intervention-based Social; Non US
Elementary School Students' Information Literacy: Instructional Design and Evaluation of a Pilot Training Focused on Misinformation,"Artmann, Benedikt; Scheibenzuber, Christian; Nistor, Nicolae","Online news literacy training has been so far insufficiently conducted and evaluated, and even less so with younger news consumers. Against the backdrop of online news cognitive processing, interventions against misinformation, and inquiry-based learning, we designed, conducted, and evaluated a pilot online news literacy training with 36 elementary school students from Germany. In a causal comparison, quantitative data from N = 29 students attest high participant acceptance and substantial effects of the inquiry-based training on participants' ability to correctly assess online news credibility, and on the corresponding cognitive processing route, moving this from intuitive to analytic processing. Despite the small sample, the experiment was only underpowered regarding the between-subject effect, whereas the power was sufficient for all other effects. These encouraging findings of the pilot training may be the result of knowledge reorganization associated with inquiry-based learning. Further educational research and practice are needed to understand the efficacy of the training at scale.",2023,1/1/23,Journal of Media Literacy Education,15,2,31-43,,10.23860/JMLE-2023-15-2-3,,#590,Artmann 2023,,Demo - Youth; Intervention Formal (classroom); Non US
"Impacts of a Digital Literacy Intervention on Preservice Teachers' Civic Online Reasoning Abilities, Strategies, and Perceptions","Weisberg, Lauren; Kohnen, Angela; Dawson, Kara","The rapid expansion of technology and the internet has changed how we access and interact with information as a society. Amid this phenomenon, people of all ages and backgrounds struggle to evaluate the credibility of information they encounter online, including teachers. In order to ensure that the next generation of K-12 students are digitally literate, teacher education programs have a responsibility to improve preservice teachers' civic online reasoning (COR) abilities. Curricular interventions that teach COR strategies have shown potential in improving students' ability to detect misinformation online. This paper explores how a digital literacy intervention in an educational technology course impacted preservice teachers' COR abilities, strategies, and perceptions. Findings revealed that after the intervention, preservice teachers' COR abilities improved, their evaluation strategies evolved from content- to context-related, and their perceptions of scientific merit shifted from a surface-level understanding to a more critical perspective. This paper provides practical and scalable curricular recommendations for teacher educators and highlights the value of integrating COR interventions with sociocultural literacy theories.",2022,1/1/22,Journal of Technology and Teacher Education,30,1,73-98,,,,#600,Weisberg 2022,,Demo - University; Demo - Youth; Intervention Formal (classroom)
Winning the War on State-Sponsored Propaganda: Results from an Impact Study of a Ukrainian News Media and Information Literacy Program,"Murrock, Erin; Amulya, Joy; Druckman, Mehri; Liubyva, Tetiana","From 2015-2016, IREX implemented a media literacy training program called Learn to Discern (L2D) that trained Ukrainian citizens to critically assess news media messages and identify misinformation. In 2017, IREX conducted a quasi-experimental impact evaluation in a stratified random sample of L2D participants and a control group (n=412) matched for gender, age, region and education levels. A news literacy assessment was administered under two scenarios: an objective news article and a disinformation-based news article that included a series of questions to assess media analysis skills, knowledge of the news media environment and Media Locus of Control. Results show statistically significant higher levels of news analysis skills and knowledge of the news media environment for L2D participants, controlling for geographic region, education level, age, and gender. The results also found that news media behaviors acquired during the training persisted over a year following the training. In both groups, those who had a better ability to correctly identify disinformation also had better knowledge of how news media works, and slightly greater sense of control (assessed as Media Locus of Control) over their media choices. Future news media literacy programs should balance identifying and evaluating objective news stories and disinformation to ensure individuals are truly media literate in today's news media environment.",2018,1/1/18,Journal of Media Literacy Education,10,2,53-85,,,,#603,Murrock 2018,,Demo - Youth; Intervention Formal (classroom); Intervention-based Social; Non US
Teaching Media Literacy: Harnessing the Charm of Storytelling with NUSHU,"Dominguez, Eva","A 2018 study conducted by the independent, non-profit organization The Commission on Fake News and The Teaching of Critical Literacy Skills reported that only 2% of children have the literacy skills they need to determine if a news story is real or fake. Over 50% of the teachers in the study believe that current curriculum does not equip children with the literacy skills they need to identify fake news. The author emphasizes that giving students the tools to be critical of information sources is an absolutely necessary competence that needs to be integrated into schools. NUSHU is a novel idea for building children's media literacy, turning global news into an exciting adventure for children. NUSHU uses comics and augmented reality to engage children in a series of adventures about global current issues while giving them an active role in the information-gathering process. NUSHU is also a tool the teacher can use to work on informational competencies, such as searching for information, verifying informational sources, debating, and developing critical thinking. Through NUSHU, children learn how to sort through the vast amount of information available in the world and develop critical thinking skills while taking part in a series of fascinating adventures.",2019,1/1/19,Childhood Education,95,5,44-48,,10.1080/00094056.2019.1663095,,#617,Dominguez 2019,,Demo - Youth; Intervention - nonempirical; Intervention Formal (classroom); Intervention-based Social; Non US
Psychological underpinnings of misinformation countermeasures: A systematic scoping review,"Ziemer, Carolin-Theresa; Rothmund, Tobias","There has been substantial scholarly effort to (a) investigate the psychological underpinnings of why individuals believe in misinformation, and (b) develop interventions that hamper their acceptance and spread. However, there is a lack of systematic integration of these two research lines. We conducted a systematic scoping review of empirically tested psychological interventions (N = 176) to counteract misinformation. We developed an intervention map and analyzed boosting, inoculation, identity management, nudging, and fact-checking interventions as well as various subdimensions. We further examined how these interventions are theoretically derived from the two most prominent psychological accounts for misinformation susceptibility: classical and motivated reasoning. We find that the majority of misinformation studies examined fact-checking interventions, are poorly linked to basic psychological theory and not geared towards reducing motivated reasoning. Based on this, we outline future research avenues for effective psychological countermeasures against misinformation.

Misinformation Is Contagious: Middle school students learn how to evaluate and share information responsibly through a digital game,"Barzilai, Sarit; Mor-Hagani, Shiri; Abed, Fayez; Tal-Savir, Danna; Goldik, Na'ama; Talmon, Ina; Davidow, Ohad","Digital games have emerged as promising tools for countering the spread of misinformation online. Previous studies have mostly used games to inoculate players against misleading communication techniques. There has also been a lack of research on misinformation games in middle school. Hence, the aims of this investigation were to examine to what extent a game can support middle school students' competence to evaluate online information and their dispositions to share information responsibly. For this purpose, we developed a game, Misinformation Is Contagious, that models reliable evaluation strategies and the social implications of sharing (in)accurate information. In two studies with 7th and 8th grade students (N = 84 and N = 131), we found that playing the misinformation game resulted in better accuracy discernment, sharing discernment, and metastrategic knowledge about corroboration, compared to playing a control language game. In Study 1, the effects on discernment scores were mainly due to higher ratings of accurate messages; whereas in Study 2, the effects were mainly due to lower ratings of inaccurate messages. In both studies, accuracy discernment mediated the effect of playing the misinformation game on sharing discernment. In Study 2, the misinformation game also had a direct effect on sharing discernment, suggesting it may have impacted players' dispositions to value accuracy while sharing. However, the game did not affect students' self-reported stances regarding sharing misinformation. These results provide initial evidence that a game designed to support evaluation strategies can help students resist misinformation and identify reliable information. The findings also suggest that games can potentially promote responsible information sharing.

Inoculation against conspiracy theories: A consumer side approach to india's fake news problem,"Iyengar, Ananya; Gupta, Poorvi; Priya, Nidhi","We attempt to replicate Roozenbeek and van der Linden's Western‚Äêbased study in India by employing the Bad News Game, an online game, in which players take on the role of a misinformation tycoon. They are exposed to weakened doses of the strategies employed in conspiracy and fake news production with the aim to cognitively inoculate them against misinformation. The proliferation of inexpensive mobile connections coupled with a lack of digital literacy has resulted in a conspiratorial pandemic in developing countries like India. We test the game's impact on an Indian sample (n = 1002) using a within‚Äêsubject design. We provide evidence of significant improvement in the ability of participants to identify the misinformation produced using Conspiracy, Impersonation, and to a lesser extent, the Discrediting technique, while observing greater truth discernment in correctly identifying true news.

Good news about Bad News: Gamified inoculation boosts confidence and cognitive immunity against fake news,"Basol, Melisa; Roozenbeek, Jon; van der Linden, Sander","Recent research has explored the possibility of building attitudinal resistance against online misinformation through psychological inoculation. The inoculation metaphor relies on a medical analogy: by pre-emptively exposing people to weakened doses of misinformation cognitive immunity can be conferred. A recent example is the Bad News game, an online fake news game in which players learn about six common misinformation techniques. We present a replication and extension into the effectiveness of Bad News as an anti-misinformation intervention. We address three shortcomings identified in the original study: the lack of a control group, the relatively low number of test items, and the absence of attitudinal certainty measurements. Using a 2 (treatment vs. control) √ó 2 (pre vs. post) mixed design (N = 196) we measure participants‚Äô ability to spot misinformation techniques in 18 fake headlines before and after playing Bad News. We find that playing Bad News significantly improves people‚Äôs ability to spot misinformation techniques compared to a gamified control group, and crucially, also increases people‚Äôs level of confidence in their own judgments. Importantly, this confidence boost only occurred for those who updated their reliability assessments in the correct direction. This study offers further evidence for the effectiveness of psychological inoculation against not only specific instances of fake news, but the very strategies used in its production. Implications are discussed for inoculation theory and cognitive science research on fake news.

In Fall 2020, college students (N = 221) in an online general education civics course were taught through asynchronous assignments how to use lateral reading strategies to fact-check online information. Students improved from pretest to posttest in the use of lateral reading to fact-check information; lateral reading was predicted by the number of assignments completed and students' reading comprehension test scores. Students reported greater use, endorsement, and knowledge of Wikipedia at posttest, aligning with the curriculum's emphasis on using Wikipedia to investigate information sources. Students also reported increased confidence in their ability to fact-check COVID-19 news. While confidence was related to perceived helpfulness of the assignments, it was only weakly associated with lateral reading.

The initial stage of the study incorporated: (i) a factorial design with 40 intervention combinations; and (ii) a contextual adaptive design, increasing the probability of assignment to treatments that worked better for previous subjects with similar characteristics. The second stage evaluated the best-performing treatments and a targeted treatment assignment policy estimated from the data. We precisely estimate null effects from warning flags and related article suggestions, tactics used by social media platforms. However, nudges to consider information's accuracy reduced misinformation sharing relative to control by 4.9% (estimate = -2.3 pp, s.e. = 1.0 , Z = -2.31, p = 0.021, 95% CI = [-4.2 , -0.35]).

Facing disinformation: Five methods to counter conspiracy theories amid the Covid-19 pandemic,"Guan, TR; Liu, TY; Yuan, RD","Among the burgeoning discussions on the argumentative styles of conspiracy theories and the related cognitive processes of their audiences, research thus far is limited in regard to developing methods and strategies that could effectively debunk conspiracy theories and reduce the harmful influences of conspiracist media exposure. The present study critically evaluates the effectiveness of five approaches to reducing conspiratorial belief, through experiments (N=607) conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results demonstrate that the content-based methods of counter conspiracy theory can partly mitigate conspiratorial belief. Specifically, the science- and fact-focused corrections were able to effectively mitigate conspiracy beliefs, whereas media literacy and inoculation strategies did not produce significant change. More crucially, our findings illustrate that both audience-focused methods, which involve decoding the myth of conspiracy theory and re-imagining intergroup relationships, were effective in reducing the cognitive acceptance of conspiracy theory. Building on these insights, this study contributes to a systematic examination of different epistemic means to influence (or not) conspiracy beliefs -an urgent task in the face of the infodemic threat apparent both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,2021,COMUNICAR,,,,,10.3916/C69-2021-06,,#2706,Guan 2021,,Domain-Health; Non US; Review (Intervention)

Escape the Fake: Development and Evaluation of an Augmented Reality Escape Room Game for Fighting Fake News,"Paraschivoiu, Irina; Buchner, Josef; Praxmarer, Robert; Layer-Wagner, Thomas","Today's digital natives easily master new devices, but there is a greater need to provide them with a strong foundation of attitudes, skills and values to interpret the world around them. Moreover, in the context of remote schooling, providing students with opportunities to learn outside of the classroom and in an interactive manner is equally important. In this article, we address these issues by providing an account of Escape Fake, an augmented reality (AR) escape room game for educating young people about fake news. We show how such a game can be designed for playing at home, thereby providing interactive learning opportunities remotely. We discuss how to teach information literacy, by introducing the design process and gameplay of Escape Fake. In our evaluation with teenagers and young adults (n=49), we investigated the flow experience, attitude towards learning effectiveness and interest in learning with an AR escape game. Escape Fake was very well accepted by youth, who are willing to play the game in their free time. These results provide considerations for educators, researchers and designers who develop educational content by means of AR escape rooms.",2021,15-Oct-21,Extended Abstracts of the 2021 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play,,,320‚Äì325,,10.1145/3450337.3483454,,#2739,Paraschivoiu 2021,,Intervention-based Individual; Non US; Topic - Game

Overcoming the Age Barrier: Improving Older Adults‚Äô Detection of Political Disinformation With Media Literacy,"S√°daba, C.; Salaverr√≠a, Ram√≥n; Bringu√©, X.","This experimental study analyzes the effect of media literacy on the ability of Spanish seniors over 50 years of age to identify fake news. The experiment measures the improvement achieved by older adults in the detection of political disinformation thanks to a digital competence course offered through WhatsApp. The study comprises a total sample of 1,029 individuals, subdivided into a control group (n = 531) and an experimental group (n = 498), from which a qualified experimental subsample (n = 87) was extracted. Results reveal that participants‚Äô political beliefs, ranging from left to right positions, influence their ability to detect misinformation. A progressive political position is associated with higher accuracy in identifying right-biased news headlines and lower accuracy for left-biased headlines. A conservative position is associated with higher accuracy when the news headline has a progressive bias, but lower accuracy when the headline is right-wing. Users are more critical when the headline has a bias against theirs, while they are more likely to believe news that confirms their own beliefs. The study adds evidence on the relevance of cognitive biases in disinformation and supports the convenience of designing specific media literacy actions aimed at older adults.",2023,2023,,,Query date: 2024-08-08 12:22:47,,,,,#2755,S√°daba 2023,,Demo - Elderly; Domain-Politics; Intervention-lab; Non US
Playing With Fake News: State Of Fake News Video Games,"DeJong, Scott","Employed almost synonymously with disinformation and misinformation, fake news refers to the increasing discourse of misconfigured news and information being shared online which has prompted global concern. Calls for digital literacy have come from researchers, governments, and public interest groups who developing an array of resources for the public. Games are one intervention. This article explores what it refers to as ‚Äòfake news games‚Äô. Not focusing on a specific game genre, it considers video games that discuss or present fake news as central to their play or design. This paper evaluates how fake news is being presented in games and asks how the concept understood across these games. By analyzing the content, skills, and goals in these games, it situates fake news alongside digital literacy skills to see how the term is being re-framed by the medium of games. Twenty-two games were studied from a larger sample collected in late 2020. Through play analysis of twenty-two fake news video games collected in 2020 this paper provides an overview of game‚Äôs that discuss fake news. Games were play-tested and recorded to see the range of content, skills and central themes that were invoked in these games. These led to findings discussing the design, core premise, and general discourse around fake news that was promoted through play. The findings in this article offer value for future directions of discussion and game design focused on fake news. By pointing to gaps and differences in games in the field, this article offers potential information for designers while also highlighting how fake news is re-framed by these games. It emphasizes which points of interest around fake news are commonly being brought up, and points to future design and implementation considerations for scholars and designers.",2013,2013,,,Query date: 2024-08-08 12:22:47,,,,,#2801,DeJong 2013,,Review (Intervention); Topic - Conceptual; Topic - Game
The Future of News Literacy in a Connected World,"Kruger, A.","The University of Hong Kong‚Äôs ‚ÄúCyber News Verification Lab‚Äù was founded in June 2016, and is arguably the first of its kind in Asia, as a focused, experiential project developing undergraduates‚Äô online verification skills. It has been hailed as ‚ÄúAhead of the curve‚Äù in online and social media fact checking education by the industry‚Äôs groundbreaking verification journalists. In September 2016, Meedan, (a founding partner of First Draft News including Google News Labs) joined the experiment by providing access and technical support to their open source verification platform called ‚ÄòCheck‚Äô. The project led to a significant increase in the quality of verification techniques and critical thinking actions by students. This paper discusses the curriculum design and initial findings from the Cyber News Verification Lab implemented into News Literacy courses at HKU in Semester 2, 2016-17. The paper also outlines current developments towards a news literacy verification rating scale ‚Äì that arose from measures created by the instructor to assess student outcomes from the experiential project. BACKGROUND The University of Hong Kong‚Äôs ‚ÄúCyber News Verification Lab‚Äù experiment was first implemented via foundation undergraduate courses at the Journalism and Media Studies Center in 2016. The lab received teaching development grant funding from HKU to support innovations in curriculum design. The Cyber News Verification Lab began as an experimental side project in experiential learning, and quickly became a major component of foundation journalism classes including News Literacy, and reporting and writing classes. The partnership with Meedan saw a collaboration with HKU students‚Äô beta testing from Semester 1, 2016-17, the latest version of the Check software, with the feedback directly informing digital coders. The interface was then implemented by industry professionals in Election.Land to fact check the 2016 US Presidential polls; in CrossCheck during the 2017 French elections; and by University of Hong Kong students in the 2017 Chief Executive Elections in Hong Kong. INTRODUCTION The objective of the HKU Cyber News Verification Lab is for students to develop and apply a critical thinking lens to meet the challenges and pressure of reporting in a post web 2.0 digital age, where they: identify, analyse and deconstruct real-life case studies emanating in real-time from online sources, and, evaluate and report on their findings in a journalistic manner. Students simultaneously learn how to apply critical thinking skills from a News Literacy perspective, as well as practical digital skills to ‚Äòdebunk and discern‚Äô online information and make sense from the constant ‚Äònoise‚Äô flowing from photos, videos and messages online. As most students at the University of Hong Kong are multi-lingual, they bring with them several languages, mostly from across Asia. Students debunk social media observations from these e-language cultures, and translate them into the University‚Äôs medium of instruction, English. Students learn from the lab to not only debunk information, but also to discern the motivations behind dis-information and the ramifications applicable to different parts of Asia. From auto-mated bots used to troll unsuspecting citizens, to content farm factories, and chat app ‚Äòchain‚Äô rumors, students see how social media and technology is used to spread political and racial biases, and the nuances in different parts of the region. LITERATURE REVIEW AND DEFINITIONS This literature review will very briefly define and outline research into ‚Äòfake news‚Äô or misinformation and disinformation; media literacy and measurement scales; and, finally experiential learning theory. Fake News (for wont of a better name) This research paper considers ‚Äòmotivations‚Äô behind the creation of so-called ‚Äòfake news‚Äô as a key to delineate and define the misinformation and disinformation into different group types. Frank (2015, pp. 315-316) noted the ‚Äúintentional dimension‚Äù is essential to consider in defining ‚Äòfake news‚Äô, for example, mistakes made by a news outlet may arise from unintended human error, quite distinct from a hoax where the creators had an intention in the beginning to trick or deceive the audience (news consumers). Clare Wardle, researcher for First Draft noted the term ‚Äòfake news‚Äô made popular by US President Donald Trump, is unhelpful, in that it doesn‚Äôt fully describe the complexities of the ‚Äúinformation ecosystem‚Äù (Wardle, 2017 Par 1). Wardle (2017, par 5) has devised a typology of ‚Äúproblematic information‚Äù in relation to the search for a better definition and term than ‚Äòfake news‚Äô. Wardle (2017, par 5) noted ‚Äúthey sit on a scale, one that loosely measures the intent to deceive:‚Äù 1. Satire or Parody ‚Äì No intention to cause harm but has potential to fool 2. Misleading Content ‚Äì Misleading use of information to frame an issue or individual 3. Imposter Content ‚Äì When genuine sources are impersonated 4. Fabricated Content ‚Äì New content is 100% false, designed to deceive and do harm 5. False Connection ‚Äì When headlines, visuals or captions don‚Äôt support the content 6. False Context ‚Äì When genuine content is shared with false contextual information 7. Manipulated Content ‚Äì When genuine information or imagery is manipulated to deceive (Source: First Draft News, 2017). Media Literacy and Measurement Scales The News Literacy curriculum at the University of Hong Kong teaches News Literacy concepts to digital native students with the aim of developing critical thinking so that students can make informed decisions about the media in which they consume and participate. However, the aim of this experiential project was to extend and enrich how students put their knowledge into practice through verification and fact-checking in real-life, real-time cases. Renee Hobbs (2004, p. 56) noted ‚Äúteachers must design learning experiences that help students, as quickly as possible, to stand on their own two feet ‚Äì able to critically analyse and create messages in a culture that is densely saturated with an ever-changing array of media messages and technology tools.‚Äù Early quantitative measurements of student media literacy skills were devised in Australia and combined multiple choice and open-ended questions from which evaluation instruments were created (Quinn and McMahon 1995 cited in Hobbs and Frost 2003). Hobbs and Frost (2003, p.335) adopted the Quinn and McMahon evaluation instrument in a study of ninth grade students and concluded there was a positive effect on students‚Äô literacy levels and critical thinking: ‚ÄúAfter 12 weeks of instruction, findings showed that students whose teachers integrated media-literacy concepts and activities with existing curriculum outperformed those in other classes whose teachers used ‚Äúoff the shelf‚Äù curriculum‚Äù. These initial studies led to developments of established ‚Äògrading scales‚Äô in media literacy. A more recent study by Maksl et al (2017) surveyed news media literacy levels in college students at Stony Brook University in New York. Results showed students who had taken News Literacy course had significantly higher knowledge of current affairs and were more motivated to follow the news compared to those who hadn‚Äôt. However, the survey used a prepared Likert scale and multiple-choice questions ‚Äì there was no space for ‚Äòreal time‚Äô reaction to measure how students would ‚Äústand on their own two feet‚Äù as suggested by Hobbs (2004) above. This paper argues there is room for a measurement scale to focus on measuring the quality of verification steps and considerations students take when they apply their skills to real world, real time scenarios. While media literacy is a well-established area of research, measurement scales need to address News Literacy competencies and critical thinking skills in a digital native, participatory, ‚Äòpost-truth‚Äô era. This has arguably never been more important in Asia given the implications social media can cause in political campaigns, geo politics, and society in this diverse, and highly mobile-connected region. While new research is emerging in the media literacy subset of News Literacy, there are little, if any ‚Äúrigorous assessment tools to gauge the impact of (news literacy) pedagogical methods‚Äù (Kajimoto, 2016, p. 148). This paper extends the focus on ‚Äúpedagogical methods‚Äù to pedagogical outcomes and skills obtained (and retained) by students. Experiential Learning Kolb (1984, p. 41) defines Experiential Learning Theory as ‚Äúthe process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. Knowledge results from the combination of grasping and transforming experience.‚Äù Experiential learning is not new to higher education journalism schools such as the University of Hong Kong‚Äôs Journalism and Media Studies Center, where all undergraduate journalism majors, (taught by academics with current or past journalism experience) must also undertake a meaningful internship in a media organisation in order to graduate. Brandon (2002, p. 62) describes experiential learning as ‚Äúa process during which a person experiences an event, acquires competencies, and then compares the knowledge gained with knowledge gained in similar situations.‚Äù METHODS The Cyber News Verification Lab forms part of the author‚Äôs PhD research thesis. The research includes an experiential experiment, case study analysis and interviews with media experts in the form of modified Delphi iterations (where the experts can be called up to continue to advise and comment according to different stages and progress throughout the study). In the first semester of the project, the experiment was implemented using a control group, with results (available in the PhD thesis) informing the implementation of verification exercises for the second semester.

Inoculation Can Reduce the Perceived Reliability of Polarizing Social Media Content.,"HARROP, ISOBEL; ROOZENBEEK, JON; MADSEN, JENS KOED; VAN DER LINDEN, SANDER","Little research is available on psychological interventions that counter susceptibility to polarizing online content. We conducted 3 studies (n1 = 472, n2 = 193, n3 = 772) to evaluate whether psychological resistance against polarizing social media content can be conferred, using the Bad News game, a ""technique-based inoculation"" intervention that simulates a social media feed. We investigate (1) whether technique-based inoculation can reduce susceptibility to content designed to fuel intergroup polarization; (2) whether technique-based inoculation can offer cross-protection against misinformation techniques that people were not inoculated against; and (3) whether political ideology plays a role in how people engage with anti-misinformation interventions. In Studies 1 and 3 (but not Study 2), we found that technique-based inoculation significantly reduces the perceived reliability of polarizing content and offers partial cross-protection against untreated misinformation techniques. We found no effect for attitudinal certainty and news-sharing intentions. Finally, we report preliminary evidence that people may choose to engage with politically congruent news topics within the intervention.
